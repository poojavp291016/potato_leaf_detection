# potato_leaf_detection
This project focuses on detecting diseases in potato leaves using deep learning techniques By classifying images into categories such as Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight, the model helps farmers quickly identify infections and take timely action. Using the PlantVillage dataset and a CNN-based model (or transfer learning with models like ResNet/MobileNet), the system achieves high accuracy in leaf classification.

The application can be used for real-time disease prediction by simply uploading a leaf image, making it a valuable tool for smart farming. This solution aims to support sustainable agriculture and minimize crop loss through early detection.
